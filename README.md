# IMDB Movie Review Classification
This project aims at designing a Neural Network to perform binary classification of reviews from the IMDB movie review data set to determine wheather the reviews are positive or negetive using Keras and Python Libraries.

There are 50,000 highly polarized reviews split in half to testing and training.
Each set has an equal number of positive and negetive reviews.

The output label 0 corresponds to negetive review while 1 to positive review.

There are two ways in which data can be pre processed ie using one hot encoding or use embedding layer.
Both are shown.
